## Pull Request Guidelines

1. All new detection rules must include unit tests in `rules_test.go`
2. All new rules must have fixtures in `fixtures/vulnerable/` and `fixtures/clean/`
3. Tests must pass with `-race`: `make test`
4. Lint must pass: `make lint`
5. Security scan must pass: `make security`
6. No network calls in file-based scanners
7. No `os/exec` in any scanner
8. No `init()` that mutates global state

## Adding a New Rule

1. Add the rule function to the appropriate `rules.go` file
2. Add the rule check to `runAllRules()` in `scanner.go`
3. Add tests to `rules_test.go`
4. Add a vulnerable fixture with header comments
5. Verify the clean fixture produces zero findings
